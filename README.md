# LED-Jig

## Overview

The LED Jig is a 3d printable "jig" to hold LEDs in place or against a panel,
to help ensure the LEDs are installed / soldered with a consistent depth.

## Status

This should work just fine directly in OpenSCAD! It has not yet been tested on
Thingiverse - some customization is still needed.

## TODO

- Add appropriate metadata for Thingiverse customizer
- Take screenshots
- Improve documentation
  - Better explanation of purpose
  - Photos or videos of use
- Add functionality
  - Legs?
